### About Me
![AviD](/assets/images/AviD.png)

Hi! I am **Avi Douglen**. 
I am the founder and CEO of Bounce Security, a boutique software security consulting agency. We work primarily with software teams, helping them level up their product security in the most efficient way by making them want to do more for security, but never fighting them into it.  

I started attending OWASP chapter meetings way back in **2006**, and started volunteering shortly after. After supporting my chapter's board for a few years, I was asked to lead it as **Chapter Chairman**. During my stint as Chairman, I helped grow the OWASP Israel chapter into a thriving community with one of the largest appsec conferences around, with close to *1000 people attending the last AppSecIL* we were able to hold in person. 

Since passing on that title, I continue to support the current chapter leadership on the **chapter board**, and have recently rebooted one of our **documentation projects**. I also serve on the **Chapters Committee as Vice-Chair**, helping to drive the Chapter Policy update and leading the Regional Chapters model, amongst other activities. 

Professionally, I've worked in QA, as a professional developer, as team lead, research director, startup CTO, and most often as a software security consultant. I am an advisor to several startups, and I am on the **Board of Advisors** for a VC incubator. I also co-authored the **Threat Modeling Manifesto**, volunteered as a **high school mentor**, and I am also a **community moderator** on Security.StackExchange.com.

For years, I've been volunteering and contributing for OWASP - for other organizations as well, but the OWASP community has always had a special place in my heart. We've had some rough patches in the past, but I feel that now we are on a very healthy path. I might not agree with every decision made - heck, I'm often the first to argue about it! But even when I don't love the conclusion, we reach it together, in a very healthy manner, with consideration for most viewpoints and overall transparency. 

I would like to support this trend, and push to consider even more viewpoints, to be even more transparent, to ensure a healthy, non-toxic environment at all levels. I feel that the leaders of the community, and the Board of Directors in particular, should be there with the sole intention of serving the community, and our mission. It should not be for the purpose of enhancing one's resume, corporate marketing, or for personal gain, fame, or game (except for rhyming, that should be allowed). 

**I would like to be on the Board of Directors of OWASP** to push back - hard - against any misuse for personal interests, against narrow-sighted or narrow-minded decisions, and for healthy dialogue in a vibrant community, and for no less than emphatically ethical efforts (alliteration should also be approved).

#### OWASP has great resources for different people and different roles: CISOs, AppSec Managers, Pentesters, Analysts, Developers, DevOps, QA, and even users. Currently, most of them are either not aware of OWASP, or consider OWASP as a short for the "OWASP Top 10". What practical steps should OWASP take to change that?

At the same time, jobs in AppSec are moving from analyst positions to lower paid engineering positions. What do you see as being OWASP's role in the industry in ten years and how would you begin to position OWASP to get there?
